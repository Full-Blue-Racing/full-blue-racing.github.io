Established in 2006, TTP Full Blue Racing comprises of around 60 students from all years, mainly from within the Department of Engineering. Each year, we design and build a single seater racing car to be entered in international Formula Student competitions, against universities from around the world.

Our aim is to inspire our undergraduates to become innovative engineers, by equipping our members with the skills required for their future careers, in both the technical and business aspects. We have numerous graduates and placement students taking up positions in high calibre race teams, and have gone on to work in various industries such as F1 and consultancy.

We have successfully competed on the circuits of Silverstone, Hockenheim and Barcelona, where we were ranked as the Best British Team at FS Spain 2016. We have previously won the Most Enterprising Society in the prestigious RBS ESSA Awards in 2014, which recognises the countryâ€™s most enterprising students.
