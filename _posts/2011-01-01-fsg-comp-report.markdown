Full Blue Racing have returned from the Formula Student Germany competition at Hockenheim  with the team’s first ever dynamic points. 

The team worked hard after coming back from the Formula Student UK competition at Silverstone to address all the known issues on the car. With some modifications on the Megasquirt2 ECU, the engine started again. The team took the car to North Weald Bassett for track testing, during which crucial knowledge about the vehicle was obtained and reliability problems were addressed. 

The team arrived at Hockenheim on Tuesday with high morale. The final touches were finished before going to scrutineering on Wednesday. Unfortunately, some small issues (such as positive locking mechanism on the steering system, insulation of the battery positive terminal, etc.) rendered it impossible to pass scrutineering the first time. Joining the queue early on Thursday morning helped the team pass re-scrutineering early and carry on to pass the tilt test. However, the good luck did not stay. The team had the scrutineering sticker taken away 4 times in the next 2 days when the scrutineers spotted aspects on the car they were not satisfied with at various occasions. This was rather disastrous. Had these problems been identified the first time, they could have all been fixed relatively easily. Having to fix these small problems on separate occasions and then re-join the queue for scrutineering cost us crucial time in the competition. This meant the car could not compete in the skid pad and acceleration events. 

Nevertheless we did not give up. With persistence and determination, we eventually passed the final noise and brake test, which allowed us to race! Despite the heavy shower making the track extremely difficult for the drivers, we successfully completed the sprint event, winning our first ever dynamic points. The team carried on to participate in the endurance event on Sunday with high hopes. Unfortunately a drivetrain failure rendered it impossible to complete the event. 

The team continued its relatively strong performance in the static events, finishing at 51st, 25th and 40th respectively for Business Presentation, Cost Analysis and Engineering Design. Overall we came 55th, not as good as expected given the hard work that has been dedicated to the project throughout the year. However, with the breakthrough in the dynamic events this year, the team is confident that they can carry the success one step further next year. 

The FBR11 would not have been possible without our sponsors and supporters who have provided vital resources, advice and encouragement — thank you to all those involved.
